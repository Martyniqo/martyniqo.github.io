### <span style="color: lightblue;"> About Me
I am known for my meticulousness and unwavering determination to achieve my career aspirations. My goal is to obtain a position as a Data Analyst or Data Scientist. I am looking for a job that will give me the opportunity to increase my proficiency in Python programming and cloud technology through hands-on involvement in various projects. I enjoy working as part of a team and am able to take a leadership role.

### <span style="color: lightblue;">Work Experience
<span style="color: #FFA500;">**GenAI Engineer**<br>
*Orange* (2023.07 - present)

Developed cutting-edge applications leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) including the latest from OpenAI, with a focus on custom ChatGPT API integration for text and image-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).

Major projects included the **Recruiter Assistant Chatbot** for optimizing resume handling and the **Sales Assistant Chatbot** for managing contracts and tabular data.

- Implemented LLMs (GPT, llama2, bison) to create a sophisticated mechanism for accurate text segmentation, generating embeddings, and integrating these into a vector database for enhanced data retrieval using Function Calling (FC).
- Applied LLMs for Natural Language Understanding (NLU) tasks, including user intent classification and context extraction.
- Engineered a privacy-centric feature to anonymize personal data using regex and spaCy.
- Utilized ChromaDB for embedding a knowledge base comprising candidates’ information, contract details, and tabular data from contracts.
- Innovated a unique method for text segmentation based on chapters, assigning relevant metadata to each segment.
- Initially experimented with LangChain, but transitioned to more stable and efficient solutions directly from OpenAI and Chroma, which in my opinion are better suited for production environments.
- Adjusted the parameters of the vector database, discovering and implementing customizations that significantly enhanced the retrieval process.

<span style="color: #FFA500;">**Business Intelligence Assistant**<br>
